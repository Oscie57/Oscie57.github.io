        <p>By adding my bot to your guild, you allow me (as the owner) to see the guild name, description, icon, member count, and any other information disclosable by the Discord API.<br><br>Read more about Discord API's Terms and Conditions at <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy">https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal">https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal</a>. Guidelines and Terms of Service, read <a href="https://dis.gd/terms">https://dis.gd/terms</a> for more info.<br><br>Messages and Audit Logs are not logged by me due to privacy reasons and will not interfere with any other system you have in place nor should it ever. If you are looking for a message/moderation logger than this bot is not for you. It is purely for entertainment purposes.<br><br>Lotte Bot currently (using the provided invite link) has the following permissions: "Read Message History", "Use External Emojis" and "Read Messages/View Channels". These are to ensure that the bot works correctly. It will not do anything without your action and will never have any moderation commands. The only commands available will always be shown inside the help command unless it is only required for testing/owner purposes.</a></p>

# oscie57.github.io/feature-jekyll-transition
A website for oscie

## Credit
Wicycool - Website design inspiration
WiiLink24 - Jekyll Template

## Building
`oscie.net` is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a site generator using Ruby.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). Typically, the latest version is what you want to install.
2. Ensure `bundle`, a dependency management system for Ruby, is installed by running `gem install bundler`.
3. Run `bundle install` to pull in Jekyll and other dependencies.
4. You can now run `bundle exec jekyll serve`! By default, the site will be available on http://localhost:4000.

                        Spotify Statistics is a Discord application that tracks Spotify data between 100k+ users on the Discord platform and displays it to the user in an easy to understand format. It is in over 40 servers currently (and it can be in yours too!). To have your data included in this experiment, make sure to have your Spotify account connected to your Discord account via the "Connections" page in Settings. The bot uses Slash commands to interact.
